   - Enables animations, slideshows, live search, interactive maps.

3. 🌐 Client-Side Scripting
   - Code executes directly in the user’s browser.
   - Enhances performance & responsiveness by reducing server requests.

4. 🖥️ Server-Side Development
   - With Node.js, JavaScript runs on the server as well.
   - Used for building backend services, REST APIs, handling databases.

5. 📱 Beyond the Web
   - Mobile apps → React Native, Ionic
   - Desktop apps → Electron, Tauri
   - Even IoT devices and game development (via frameworks & engines).
